I accept each one as they are.


I accept you the way you are.

Train the mind to respond, not react

Expectation or accept which one is easy? => Accept

No expectation ... only acceptance

Gratitude - way of happy life

no need to take care at what time you want to wake up, just take care to sleep early.


Teaching our mind to think right way



how can he say like this - chosen hurt

I am not going to forget this - chosen hurt
Nobody respect me - chosen hurt


chose - his sanskar,perspective, mood  => chosen stability, heeling in that relationship

Train the mind to respond, not react


don't put the label on people

How many people irretating me?
No one

some people are doing nothing and say very busy
some people are doing work 16 hours a day and say very easy

busy,hurried - chances of getting irretating is higher => battery down
easy - charged


Train the mind to respond, not react


unconditional acceptance - nice word
