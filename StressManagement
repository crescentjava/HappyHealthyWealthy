Reason of pressure
1) lack of Money  => earn money more than need
2) expenses more than earning => earn more to complete our desires
3) bcaz of comparison with higher and lower also
comparison of any kind creates pressure

=> never go for comparison
4)expectations
   if you try to change others
   even the front person changes you lose

world is perfect, no need to change
=>keep the expectations => zero

=> Never let others control your life


1- need se jyada paisa
2- kharche kamai se kam
3-comparison ke keede se bachna


Don't save what is left after spending; spend what is left after saving.
