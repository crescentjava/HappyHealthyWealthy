How is my time distributed


Time is energy

When you say I don't have time, that means you are saying you don't have energy

Four types of energy:
1)Physical energy
   eating habits, excercise

2)Emotional energy:
   confidence,
   self control
   comfortable relationship with others
   listening skill

3)Mental energy
   positive talk?
   I can do it 
   creativity
   explore
   optimisam(good time for future)
4)Spiritual energy
    commitment
    integrity
    honesty with others, with self


If you don't have energy, can't manage your schedule, can't utilize your time
e.g.
Friday night party, late sleeping
Saturday schedule created for whole day?
can we achieve Saturday's target
You won't find energy after wakeup

when enery is highest - imp - y urgent - n 
when energy is lowest - pickup job of non-urgent and non-important

with highest energy - netflix/chips/phone calls....wasting your energy

Properly align energy and time allocation

always align most important things with highest energy


3) Time is money
Time has value
Time is not free

E.g.
Salary 100000
working days in a month - 22
working hours in a day - 8
570/hour

salary 50k  285/hr

Opportunity cost - 
e.g.
Netflix - 499 per month
daily you are watching 1 hour
how much amount you are spending in a month

is Rs 499 per month ans correct?
No

You are spending 499+(570*30=17100)

Would you spend 17600 on netflix per month
is this hour beyond office hours?
Time is not free, its valueable, time has cost

same hour if you spend on studying/side project/investment/learning new things/explore
any activity which increases cost per hour(e.g.700 per hour)

if you say you can't earn more than existing...
anyway I am going to get same salary?.....wrong attitude

Increase your value for time

Another example:
you want to buy mobile
online price : 29999
market price : 29000 need to go to store and buy the same, for entire process spent 4 hours

with market price cost goes to 29000+(4*570=2280)=31280
If you thing if you are free to this activity, ....wrong approach

















My goal in life is to increase the value of my time.


86400 secs in a day as a bank account balance

don't think you have unlimited time

if somebody hurts you  in few secs, are you going to waste all time in day?

Clean your mobile. Delete unnecessary apps.


Busy vs Productive
Busy:
Have numerous priorities
Respond with 'YES' very fast
Keep all doors open
Keeping talking about how busy they are
Are multitaskers
Ask for advise

Productive:
Have a couple of priorities
Think twice before saying 'YES'
Close all doors
Let the result speak for themselves
Concentrate on one important goal
Take real action and get the job done
